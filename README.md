**GitHub Pages:**
I tried creating a GitHub Pages, but I had to move documents around in my folders in order to do so and this caused them not to run properly.

I have copy and pasted my code from app.js and am going to re-download all the files and start again. Essentially, I am going to clear my repository and start fresh.

I was looking online, and in order for my GitHub Pages to populate with my code, the index.html file has to be in the top of the main branch. But right now, it is embedded in the static folder.
So, instead of displaying the index.html with my final results, it is displaying my readme file. However, when I try to move the index.html file, my code no longer works and the web page is blank. I am going to include a screenshot of the results that I achieved as a work around.
